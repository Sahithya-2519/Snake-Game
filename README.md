The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where a snake moves across the screen, eating apples to grow longer. The goal is to score as many points as possible by eating apples, while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.

The game is built using Java Swing for GUI and rendered inside a JPanel. It uses a game loop driven by a javax.swing.Timer, which updates the snake's position, checks collisions, and repaints the screen
